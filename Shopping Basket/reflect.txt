1. In the world of programming, we create software not just for some particular 
brackets of users, but for everyone. Hence, in order to make sure that everyone's 
interest in covered in the software, programmers tend to add selection in the software
which makes it diverse for everyone to use. Apart from this, selection also helps in 
choosing qualtity and quality of some resources and giving the appropriate responses 
according to the user input.   

In order to gives an example from part 2, selection is used almost in every logic.

a. While asking for the quantity of produces, if someone enters the value in negative 
the program will respond with an error message and if the input is a positive integer 
it will assign the value to the appropriate variable.

b. In the event of picking up the produces, if the user enters a higher value than the
requirement of the produces, lower value than the requirement of the produces, OR the negative 
value, program responses error accordingly. While, in case of the same value as required
the program will show the success message.

c. Lastly when the shopping of produces is over, the program ask user if user want to 
do the shopping again. If user inputs 0, the program ends and if user inputs 1, the whole 
program runs again. This is also one of the example of selection. 

2. Nested construct is like sub-option inside an option. It is used to ask the user for 
more specific detail. In part 2 of this workshop, there are many places where this concept
is used.

a. The whole program is written in a do-while loop as if the user wants to run the whole 
program again, it would be possible without any issue or repeating the codes. Even inside
do-while loop is again used in case the user enters the input which generates an error message,
the whole loop runs again and ask the same question to the user untill the response is
compatable.

b. In the do-while loop inside the program, nested if-else is used. This is used to check
the input from the user. It first checks if the input is greater than the requirement of 
the produce, then it checks that the quantity is more than or equal to 0 or not, after this
it checks if the picked up quantity is less then the requirement and lastly it check
in case the picked up quantity and requirement is same. \

In non-technical language, nested means an option inside another option. 

3. My facourite iteration construct is IF-ELSE loop as it can use used in case the program wants
to check several conditions of the same input. 
When comparred to WHILE loop and DO-WHILE loop, it can just check only one condition, and 
not multiple conditions. Additionally, For loops is just used to repeat something for
some specific amount of time. It also cannot check multiple conditions.  
In part 2, I have used nested if loop to check several areas of the user input, whereas, 
DO-WHILE loop is just used to repeat the steps by checking one condition.
