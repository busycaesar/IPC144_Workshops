1. The major benefits of this kind of data types are:

   i.  It helps to declare the variables of same category together. Due to which 
       a lot of confusion does not even appears. Since we add the tag of structure 
       before using the variable, it helps to figure out want does a particular
       variable defines. 
       For Example, in this workshop, every variable contains either playerSetUp
       or gameSetUp before its name. Hence, it gets easy to figure out what does 
       the variable interprets.
   ii. It provides the facility of declaring multiple types of variables in a
       single structure. Hence, using the variable becomes very flexible.
       For Example, in this workshop, in the struct PlayerInfo, I have declared
       int type and char type variable at the same place.

2. In this case, firstly, one array has to be declared in which the total treasure
   collected each time would be stored. Secondly, at the last one printf statement
   in a for loop to print all the elements of that array.

3. The most time consuming part was to think which commands to be use to make 
   the program perform some particular task and how to put those logically and 
   sequencially. As a solution, I breaked the desired output in small parts and 
   gradually, I started using the commands first in small parts and then placed
   in the accumulated parts.
